# Service Management Schemes for IoT Devices based on gRPC and mDNS/DNS-SD
[Full Paper (PDF)](paper.pdf)

This work proposes a service management mechanism that combines **gRPC** with **mDNS/DNS-SD** to address the lack of service description and access functions in traditional IoT service discovery.  
By embedding service descriptors into the discovery process, IoT devices can achieve **zero-configuration**, efficient, and complete service management in smart home environments.
